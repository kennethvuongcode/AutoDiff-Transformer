More work could have been done on the project description and the transformer code, there were a few inconsistencies. It would have helped to have a more clear explanation of how the code was structured so that we would spend less time learning how the code worked and more time learning how transformers work. The TODO sections of the transformer code is misleading because it makes it seem that I need to implement something for EACH comment when in reality some comments share a solution.
